# Setup a Simple Personal Website
I tried following the steps mentioned in the reference folder but
I had some issues while downloading and insatlling jekyll bundler
gems, so in order to preserve time, I dint waste time to resolve
those instead I started doing the task on Hugo. I read about Hugo 
and its features on official Hugo Website. I followed the steps 
given in the website to implement a website and read about the
steps to be followed to host a website using GitHub pages.
Tooks some references for hosting in GitHub pages from reference 
folder mentioned for task-8.
