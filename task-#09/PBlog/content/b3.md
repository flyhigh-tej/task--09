Talking about the journey, it was quite difficult in the beginning to identify the best 

possible solution for every problem occured, there were days where I felt too down and 

at the extreme cases like working for a complete day and still not able to come up with

a solution to the problem encountered made me feel devastated and I thought of dropping

one my biggest dreams ever to enter amFOSS.
